## Notes

### Browser Cache
Users may need to hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R) to see favicon changes due to browser caching.

### Loading Times
All loading states set to 800ms for optimal user experience (changed from 5000ms preview mode).

### Future Considerations
- Loading states can be connected to actual API calls
- Mock data can be replaced with real backend integration
- Additional site provider vendors can be added as needed
